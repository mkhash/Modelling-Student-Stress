**Team members**: Mark Hashimoto, Sweytha Prabakaran, Jared Gutierrez, Veda Gad, Nafisa Shaik, Gayatri Dt

**Project Goal**: Exploring the Dartmouth StudentLife Dataset to undercover potential relationships between student daily habits, academic data, and mood with perceived stress. Using our findings we hope to implement a more generalizable model which can estimate levels of an individuals stress and provide relations to our models metrics and academic success.
